    <h2>Animation-Direction</h2>

    <p>
      The <b>animation-direction</b> property specifies whether an animation
      should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.
    </p>
    <p>The animation-direction property can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>normal</b> - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is
        default
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>reverse</b> - The animation is played in reverse direction
        (backwards)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>alternate</b> - The animation is played forwards first, then
        backwards
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>alternate-reverse</b> - The animation is played backwards first, then
        forwards
      </li>
    </ul>
