    <h2>Animation Fill Mode</h2>

    <p>
      The <b>animation-fill-mode</b> property specifies a style for the target
      element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it
      ends, or both).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>none</b> - Default value. Animation will
        not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>forwards</b> - The element will retain the
        style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on
        animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>backwards</b> - The element will get the
        style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on
        animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>both</b> - The animation will follow the
        rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation
        properties in both directions
      </li>
    </ul>
